            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The impact of disruptive start-ups on traditional branding</h1><p>Cabbies didn't foresee on-demand ride-sharing and car services, just as hotels didn't consider consumer to consumer home rentals. Thrift stores and local craftsmen didn't develop global e-commerce platforms for resale and handmade merchandise, just as restaurants didn't band together to find delivery drivers available through the click of a button.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/6dde30dfa3d66e0fbe5ae9f0a1486456/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fres.cloudinary.com%2Fwww-virgin-com%2Ff_auto%2Cq_80%2Fvirgin-com-prod%2Fsites%2Fvirgin.com%2Ffiles%2Fla_uber_getty.jpg"></article>]]></description>
